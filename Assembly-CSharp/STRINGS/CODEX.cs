Five hours from now, Subject #901 will make history as our first human test subject.\n\nEven at the Vertex Institute, which is twice Gravitas's size, I could've spent half my career waiting for approval to advance to human trials for such an invasive process! But Director Stern is too invested in this work to let it stagnate.\n\nMy darling Bruce always said that when you're on the right path, the universe conspires to help you. He'd be so proud of the work we do here.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nMy bio-printed multi-cerebral storage chambers (or \"mega minds\" as I've been calling them) are working! Just in time to save my job.\n\nThe Director's been getting increasingly impatient about our struggle to maintain the integrity of our growing datasets during extraction and processing. The other day, she held my report over a Bunsen burner until the flames reached her fingertips.\n\nI can only imagine how much stress she's under.\n\nThe whole world is counting on us.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nOn a hunch, I added dream content analysis to the data and...wow. Oneirology may be scientifically \"fluffy\", but integrating subconscious narratives has produced a new type of brainmap - one with more latent potential for complex processing.\n\nIf these results are replicable, we might be on the verge of unlocking the secret to creating synthetic life forms with the capacity to evolve beyond blindly following commands.\n\nNikola says that's irrelevant for our purposes. Surely Director Stern would disagree.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nNikola gave me a dataset to plug into the mega minds. He wouldn't say where it came from, but even if he had...nothing could have prepared me for what it contained.\n\nWhen he saw my face, he muttered something about how people should call me \"Tremors,\" not \"Nails\" and sent me on my lunch break.\n\nAll I could think about was those poor souls.\n\nDid they have souls?\n\n...do we?\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nIt's done. My adjustments to the memory transfer protocol are hardcoded into the machine.\n\nI finished just as Nikola stormed in.\n\nI may be too much of a coward to stand up for those unfortunate creatures, but with these new parameters in place...someday, they might be able to stand up for themselves.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n";

That was the main intent behind this project.\"\n\nThe Temporal Bow works by rapidly vibrating sections of the 4th dimension to send small quantities of mass forward and backward in time, generating massive amounts of energy with virtually no waste.\n\n\"The fantastic thing about using the 4th dimension as fuel,\" says Stern, \"is that it is really, categorically infinite\".\n\nFor those eagerly awaiting the prospect of human time travel, don't get your hopes up just yet. The Facility says that although they have successfully transported matter through time, the technology was expressly developed for the purpose of energy generation and is ill-equipped for human transportation.";

If the Temporal Bow bends to a previous point in time to a point when things were more orderly, logic would dictate that we are making this point more chaotic by taking things from it. All known laws of the natural universe suggests that this should have affected our Present Day, but all evidence points to that not being true. It appears the theory that we cannot change our past was incorrect!\n\nThis suggests that Time is, in fact, not an arrow but several arrows, each pointing different directions. Fundamentally, this proves the existence of other timelines - different dimensions - some of which we can assume have also built their own Temporal Bow.\n\nThe promise of crossing this final dimensional threshold is too tempting.
